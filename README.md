# Hands-on_Lecture_2
This repository contains two algorithms: Spiral Matrix and Pascal Triangle. These algorithms are implemented in Java, and the repository includes test cases to verify their correctness.

Contents
SpiralMatrix.java: Contains the implementation of the Spiral Matrix algorithm.
PascalTriangle.java: Contains the implementation of the Pascal Triangle algorithm.
SpiralMatrixTest.java: Contains test cases for the SpiralMatrix class.
PascalTriangleTest.java: Contains test cases for the PascalTriangle class.
